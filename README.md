## About

<p>
    I made this website by following the tutorial series "Nuxt.js Fundamentals" on
    <a href="https://vueschool.io/" target="_blank">vueschool.io</a>! The series can be found
    <a href="https://vueschool.io/courses/nuxtjs-fundamentals" target="_blank">here</a>.

    What is Nuxt.js?
   </h2>
   <p>
    <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank">Nuxt.js</a> is a framework for creating
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> websites that render server-side. Vue.js websites
    are normally 'client-side' applications. That means that they run on the user's browser and
    are detached from the web server. The problem with that is you aren't able to easily make
    your Vue web sites
    <a href="https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/seo/" target="_blank">SEO friendly</a>.
    That makes it hard to rank higher on search engines.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nuxt solves these problems by rendering your Vue webpages on the server. That way when search
    engine crawlers visit your site, they are able to see your fully rendered pages along with meta
    tags and all the things they need to see in order to rank your website on their search listings.

    Vueschool.io Tutorial Review
   </h2>
   <p>
    The <a href="https://vueschool.io/courses/nuxtjs-fundamentals" target="_blank">tutorial videos</a> gave
	enough information to finish this little project, but unfortunately
    it's about 3+ years old. This means that the Nuxt project you create now in 2021 doesn't quite match
    the code displayed in the tutorial. I was able to make a few changes and copy/pasted the CSS from the
    tutorial's <a href="https://github.com/vueschool/nuxt-fundamentals" target="_blank">Github project</a>
    to get around this. However, I'd normally expect a for-profit website like
    vueschool.io to keep their tutorials updated... at least every year.
   </p>
   <p>
    Quite a few random things just didn't match the tutorial. For instance my process to run the dev server,
    build the application, and finally 'generate' the ./dist folder for production didn't match up with
    what was done in the tutorial videos. Things like this weren't a huge issue for me, but I would imagine
    a beginner would have to take a while to figure those things out.
   </p>
   <p>
    It makes me wonder if there are newer/better ways to code a Nuxt project now which this tutorial didn't
    cover. I was able to see and learn the basics, which is the main goal of the exercise. I just wish I could
    be confident that this is the best way to get a Nuxt project started.
